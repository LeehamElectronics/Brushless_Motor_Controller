# Brushless-Motor-Controller
This project was started in 2019 as my Year 11 Physics project (practical investigation assigment). I created a brushless motor by using a fidget spinner and some electrical components such as coils and relays. This software is used for controlling the system via an Arduino board and recording scientific measurements from the system via MQTT.

Here is the research document I put together at the end of the assignment:

Thanks for checking out this project! Feel free to download and try on your own Arduino board.
